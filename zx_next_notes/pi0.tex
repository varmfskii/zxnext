\chapter{Raspberry Pi0 Acceleration}
The Spectrum Next is known to have an header (with male pins) which
can attach a Raspberry Pi Zero.

The Raspberry Pi 0 has a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC with an ARMv6 core, a
Videocore 4 GPU, and its own 512 MB memory and HDMI output. It has its
own SD card from which it boots. While it can traditionally run Linux,
it can also be programmed "bare metal" directly in assembly language,
which may be more likely for this implementation.

It is not yet known how the Raspberry Pi 0 will interface with the
Spectrum Next. It was originally used as an HDMI converter, but the
HDMI functionality was moved onto the main board, makes this
unnecessary.

It is known that the Raspberry Pi versions supporting Wi-Fi will not
provide that Wi-Fi to the Next.

\section{NextOS}
NextOS is one of the Operating Systems that is integrated into the
Next. It's based on the +3E DOS which is in turn an extension of the
+3 DOS as found on the ZX Spectrum +3. It provides access to the extra
memory via integrated Ram Disk as well as SD cards. It also supports
CP/M Plus file structures and partitions on the SD card (although
support of CP/M for the Next is still being developed), FAT16 and
FAT32 partitions, the latter with full 255 character Long File Names
(LFN). NextOS additionally supports NextBASIC's 128k full screen
editor and does not need USR0 mode to operate.

\section{EsxDOS}
esxDos is one of the operating systems that is integrated into the
Next. It provides a posix-like api to access the SD card as disk and
it provides a familiar basic interface to the disk from basic. The
current version of ESXDOS is 0.8.6; a new version 0.9.x is being
written for the Next. esxDos currently only supports the so-called
USR0 mode in BASIC (single keyword/48k Basic)

@{h2}CP/M

The ZX Spextrum Next has support for CP/M+ 3.0. CP/M was the most popular
microcomputer coperating system prior to the advent of MS-DOS.

Utilities

From the Digital Research: CP/M 3 Command Reference Manual 1984

This section documents all standard CP/M+ 3 commands plus those extras included
with the ZX Spectrum Next CP/M system.

COLOURS

Parameters:Syntax: COLOURS [RGB] paper ink

Function: Sets the screen colours

Parameters:

Parameterspaper Paper (background) colour

Parameters:ink Ink (foreground) colour

Options:

Parameters:RGB Causes ink and paper colours to be interpreted as 9-bit octal
RGB numbers

Notes: Sets the screen colours using standard ZX colours or octal 9-bit RGB
numbers.

Examples:

colours 1 6

colours rgb 000 750

COPYSYS

Parameters:Syntax: COPYSYS

Function: Copy CP/M system

Notes: COPYSYS copies the CP/M Plus system from a CP/M Plus system diskette to
another diskette. The new diskette must have the same format as the original
system diskette.

DATE

Parameters:Syntax: DATE
DATE C
DATE CONTINUOUS
DATE time-specification
DATE SET

Function: The DATE command lets you display and set the date and time of day.

Parameters:

Parameterstime-specification Time/date in the format MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS

Options:

Parameters:C Continuously show the date and time until a key is pressed

Parameters:CONTINUOUS Continuously show the date and time until a key is
pressed

Parameters:SET Prompt the user for the current date and time

Notes: The DATE command is a transient utility that lets you display and set
the date and time of day. When you start CP/M 3, the date and time are set to
the creation date of your CP/M 3 system. Use DATE to change this initial value
to the current date and time.

Examples:

DATE

DATE C

DATE CONTINUOUS

DATE 08/13/82 09:15:37

DATE SET

DEVICE

Syntax:
DEVICE
DEVICE NAMES
DEVICE VALUES
DEVICE logical-dev {XON|NOXON|baud-rate},
DEVICE physical-dev {XON|NOXON|baud-rate}
DEVICE logical-dev=physical-dev {option} {,physical-dev {option},...}
DEVICE logical-dev = NULL
DEVICE CONSOLE {PAGE}
DEVICE CONSOLE {COLUMNS=n, LINES=n}
DEVICE displays current logical device assignments and physical device names.

DIR (built-in)

Syntax:
DIR
DIR d:
DIR filespec
DIR d: options
DIR filespec,... filespec options

The DIR command displays the names of files catalogued in the directory of an
online disk that belong to current user number and have the Directory (DIR)
attribute. DIR accepts the * and ? wildcards in the file specification.

The DIR command with options displays the names of files and the
characteristics associated with the files. DIR is a built-in utility. DIR with
options is a transient utility and must be loaded into memory from the disk.

DIRSYS/DIRS (built-in)

Syntax:
DIRSYS
DIRSYS d:
DIRSYS filespec

The DIRSYS command lists the names of files in the current directory that have
the system (SYS) attribute. DIRSYS accept the * and ? wildcards in the file
specification. DIRSYS is a built-in utility.

DUMP

Syntax:
DUMP filespec

DUMP displays the contents of a file in and ASCII format.

ECHO (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
ECHO string

Echo characters to the terminal

The following special character sequences may be used

-   \a alert (bell) (ASCII 7)
-   \b backspace (ASCII 8)
-   \e escape (ASCII 27)
-   \n line feed (ASCII 10)
-   \r carriage return (ASCII 13)
-   \l interpret further characters as lower-case
-   \u interpret further characters as upper-case
-   \\backslash ('\')

Note that CP/M converts all your typed characters to upper-case before
providing them to ECHO.COM. Therefore you will need to use \l and \u to specify
the case of characters if it is important (in ESCape sequences, for example).

ED

Syntax:
ED
ED input-filespec
ED input-filespec {d: | output-filespec}

Character file editor. To redirect or rename the new version of the file
specify the destination drive or destination filespec.

ERASE/ERA (built-in)

Syntax:
ERASE
ERASE filespec
ERASE filespec [CONFIRM]

The ERASE command removes one or more files from the directory of a disk.
Wildcard characters are accepted in the filespec. Directory and data space are
automatically reclaimed for later use by another file. The ERASE command can be
abbreviated to ERA.

[CONFIRM] option informs the system to prompt for verification before erasing
each file that matches the filespec. CONFIRM can be abbreviated to C.

EXIT (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
EXIT

The EXIT command leaves CP/M (rebooting the ZX Spectrum Next)

EXPORT (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
EXPORT cpm-filespec nextzxos-filespec

NextZXOS file export utility

Export file to a NextZXOS drive.

GENCOM

Syntax:
GENCOM COM-Eilespec RSX-filespec... RSX-Eilespec {[LOADER |
SCB=(Offset,value)]}
GENCOM RSX-filespec ... RSX-filespec {[NULL | SCB=(Offset,value)l}
GENCOM filename
GENCOM filename [SCB=(offset,value)]

The GENCOM command attaches RSX files to a COM file, or creates a dummy COM
file containing only RSXS. It can also restore a previously GENCOMed file to
the original COM file without the header and RSXS, add or replace RSXs in
already GENCOMed files, and attach header records to COM files without RSXS.

GENCPM

Syntax:
GENCPM {AUTO|AUTO DISPLAY}

GENCPM creates a memory image CPM3.SYS file, containing the CP/M 3 BDOS and
customized BIOS. The GENCPM utility performs late resolution of intermodule
references between system modules. GENCPM can accept its command input
interactively from the console or from a file GENCPM.DAT.

In the nonbanked system, GENCPM creates a CPM3.SYS file from the BDOS3.SPR and
BIOS3.SPR files. In the banked system, GENCPM creates the CPM3.SYS file from
the RESBDOS3.SPR, the BNKBDOS3.SPR and the BNKBIOS3.SPR files. Remember to back
up your CPM3.SYS file before executing GENCPM, because GENCPM deletes any
existing CPM3.SYS file before it generates a new system.

GET

Syntax:
GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} FILE filespec options
GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} CONSOLE

GET directs the system to take console input from a file for the next system
comand or user program entered at the console.

Console input is taken from a file until the program terminates. If the file is
exhausted before program input is terminated, the program looks for subsequent
input from the console. If the program terminates before exhausting all its
input, the system reverts back to the console for console input.

HELP

Syntax:
HELP
HELP topic
HELP topic subtopic
HELP topic [NOPAGE]
HELP topic subtopic1...subtopic8
HELP>topic
HELP>.subtopic

HELP displays a list of topics and provides summarized information for CP/M
Plus commands.

Typing HELP topic displays information about that topic. Typing HELP topic
subtopic displays information about that subtopics One or two letters is enough
to identify the topics. After HELP displays information for your topic, it
displays the special prompt HELP> on your screen, followed by a list of
subtopics.

-   Enter ? to display list of main topics.
-   Enter a period and subtopic name to access subtopics.
-   Enter a period to redisplay what you just read.
-   Press RETURN to return to the CP/M Plus system prompt.
-   [NOPAGE] option disables the 24 lines per page console display.
-   Press any key to exit a display and return to the HELP> prompt.

HEXCOM

Syntax:
HEXCOM filename

The HEXCOM Command generates a command file (filetype COM) from a HEX input
file. it names the output tile with the same filename as the input file but
with filetype COM. HEXCOM always looks for a file with filetype HEX.

IMPORT (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
IMPORT nextzxos-filespec
IMPORT nextzxos-filespec cpm-filespec

NextZXOS file import utility

List or import files from a NextZXOS drive.

INITDIR (Not included)

Syntax:
INITDIR d:

The INITDIR command initializes a disk directory to allow date and time
stamping of files on that disk. INITDIR can also recover time/date directory
space.

NEXTREG (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
NEXTREG register {value}

NextReg Utility

Show or change a NextReg register (use at your own risk!)

LIB (Not included)

Syntax:
LIB filespec options
LIB filespec options=filespec <modifier> f,filespec<modifier>

A library is a file that contains a collection of object modules.

Use the LIB utility to create libraries, and to append, replace, select, or
delete modules from an existing library. Use LIB to obtain information about
the contents of library files. LIB creates and maintains library files that
contain object modules in Microsoft REL file format. These modules are produced
by the Digital Research relocatable macro-assembler program, RMAC, or other
language translator that produces modules in Microsoft REL file format.

You can use LINK-80 to link the object modules contained in a library to other
object files. LINK-80 automatically selects from the library only those modules
needed by the program being linked, and then forms an executable file with a
filetype of Com.

LINK (Not included)

Syntax:
LINK filespec [options]
LINK filespec [options],...filespec [options]
LINK filespec [options]=filespec [options],...
LINK combines relocatable object modules such as those produced by RMAC and
PL/I- 80 into a COM file ready for execution. Relocatable files can contain
external references and publics. Relocatable files can reference modules in
library files. LINK searches the library files and includes the referenced
modules in the output file. See the Programmer's Utilities Guide for the CP/M
Family of Operating Systems for a complete description of LINK-80.

Use LINK option switches to control execution parameters. Link options follow
the file specifications and are enclosed within square brackets. Multiple
switches are separated by commas.

MAC (Not included)

Syntax:
MAC filename [$options]

MAC, the CP/M Plus macro assembler, reads assembly language statements from a
file of type ASM, assembles the statements, and produces three output files
with the input filename and filetypes of HEX, PRN, and SYM. Filename.HEX
contains Intel hexadecimal format object code. Filename.PRN contains an
annotated source listing that you can print or examine at the console.
Filename.SYM contains a sorted list of symbols defined in the program.

Use options to direct the input and output of MAC. Use a letter with the option
to indicate the source and destination drives, and console, printer, or zero
output. Valid drive names are A through 0. X, P, and Z specify console,
printer, and zero output, respectively.

PATCH

Syntax:
PATCH filename.typ n

The PATCH command displays or installs patch number n to the CP/M Plus system
or command files. The patch number n must be between 1 and 32 inclusive.

PIP

Syntax:
PIP Destination = Source
PIP d:[Gn]=filespec [options]
PIP filespec[Gn]=filespec [options]
PIP filespec[Gn]device=filespec [options] device

The file copy program PIP copies files, combines files, and transfers files
between disks, printers, consoles, or other devices attached to your computer.
The first filespec is the destination. The second filespec is the source. Use
two or more source filespecs separated by commas to combine two or more files
into one file. [options] is any combination of the available options. The [Gn]
option in the destination filespec tells PIP to copy your file to that user
number. PIP with no command tail displays an * prompt and awaits your series of
commands, entered and processed one line at a time. The source or destination
can optionally be any CP/M Plus logical device.

PUT

Syntax:
PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option}
PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option}
PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} CONSOLE
PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} PRINTER

PUT puts console or printer output to a file for the next command entered at
the console, until the program terminates. Then console output reverts to the
console. Printer output is directed to a file until the program terminates.
Then printer output is put back to the printer.

PUT with the SYSTEM option directs all subsequent console/printer output to the
specified file. This option terminates when you enter the PUT CONSOLE or PUT
PRINTER command.

RENAME/REN (built-in)

Syntax:
RENAME
RENAME new-filespec=old-filespec

RENAME lets you change the name of a file in the directory of a disk. To change
several filenames in one command use the * or ? wildcards in the file
specifications. You can abbreviate the RENAME command to REN. REN prompts you
for input.

RMAC (Not included)

Syntax:
RMAC filespec options

RMAC, a relocatable macro assembler, assembles ASM files into REL files that
you can link to create COM files.

RMAC options specify the destination of the output files. Replace d with the
destination drive letter for the output files.

SAVE

Syntax:
SAVE

SAVE copies the contents of memory to a file. To use SAVE, first issue the SAVE
command, then run your program which reads a file into memory. Your program
exits to the SAVE utility which prompts you for a filespec to which it copies
the contents of memory, and the beginning and ending address of the memory to
be SAVED.

SET

Syntax:
SET [options]
SET d: [options]
SET filespec [options]
SET [option = modifier]
SET filespec [option = modifier]

SET initiates password protection and time stamping of files. It also sets the
file and drive attributes Read/Write, Read/Only, DIR and SYS. It lets you label
a disk and passord protect the label. To enable time stamping of files, you
must first run INITDIR to format the disk directory.

SET Default password operation:

Syntax:
SET [DEFAULT=password]

Instructs the system to use a default password if you do not enter a password
for a password-protected file.

SET Time-stamp operations:

Syntax:
SET d: [CREATE=ON|OFF]
SET d: [ACCESS=ON|OFF]
SET d: [UPDATE=ON|OFF]

The above set commands allw YOU to keep a record of the time and date of file
creation and update or of the last access update of your files.

SET Drive operations:

Syntax:
SET d: [RO]
SET d: [RW]

Adds or removes write protection from a drive.

SETDEF

Syntax:
SETDEF
SETDEF [TEMPORARY=d:]
SETDEF d:i,d:i,d:i,d:i
SETDEF [ORDER= (typ1, typn)]
SETDEF [DISPLAY | NO DISPLAY)
SETDEF [PAGE | NOPAGE]

SETDEF allows the user to display or define up to four drives for the program
search order, the drive for temporary files, and the filetype search order. The
SETDEF definitions affect only the loading of programs and/or execution of
SUBMIT (SUB) files. SETDEF turns on/off the system Display and Console Page
modes. When on, the system displays the location and name of programs loaded or
SUBmit files executed, and stops after displaying one full console screen of
information.

SHOW

Syntax:
SHOW
SHOW d:
SHOW d: [SPACE]
SHOW d: [LABEL]
SHOW d: [USERS]
SHOW d: [DIR]
SHOW d: [DRIVE]

The SHOW command displays the following disk drive information:

-   access mode and the amount of free disk space
-   disk label
-   current user number
-   number of files for each user number on the disk
-   number of free directory entries for the disk
-   drive characteristics

SID

Syntax:
SID [pgm-filespec],{sym-filespec}

The SID symbolic debugger allows you to monitor and test programs developed for
the 8080 microprocessor. SID supports real-time breakpoints, fully monitored
execution, symbolic disassembly, assembly, and memory display and fill
functions. SID can dynamically load SID utility programs to provide traceback
and histogram facilities.

SUBMIT

Syntax:
SUBMIT
SUBMIT filespec
SUBMIT filespec argument ... argument

The SUBMIT command lets you execute a group (batch) of commands from a SUBmit
file (a file with filetype of SUB).

SUB files:

The SUB file can contain the following types of lines:

-   any valid CP/M Plus command
-   any valid CP/M Plus command with SUBMIT parameters ($0-$9)
-   any data input line
-   any program input line with parameters ($0 to $9)

The command line cannot exceed 135 characters.

TERMINFO (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
TERMINFO

This program provides information on the terminal facilities provided by the
BIOS on the ZX Spectrum Next.

TERMSIZE (ZX Spectrum Next)

Syntax:
TERMSIZE top left height width

Terminal resize utility

Size can be up to 32x80 (defaults to 24x80, suitable for many programs). If
setting a reduced size, the top and left parameters can be used to make the
image more centered on your screen.

TYPE/TYP (built-in)

Syntax:
TYPE
TYPE filespec
TYPE filespec [PAGE]
TYPE filespec [NOPAGE]

The TYPE command displays the contents of an ASCII character file on your
screen.

The USER command sets the current user number. The disk directory can be
divided into distinct groups according to a User Number. User numbers range
from 0 through 15.

XREF (Not included)

Syntax:
XREF {d:} filename {$P}

XREF provides a cross-reference summary of variable usage in a program. XREF
requires the PRN and SYM files produced by MAC or RMAC for input to the
program. The SYM and PRN files must have the same filename as the filename in
the XREF command tail. XREF outputs a file of type XRF.

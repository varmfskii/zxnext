\chapter{Serial Communication}

The Spectrum Next has two independent fully featured UARTs. The UARTS
share I/O ports so it is important to select the correct one before
communicating with it. Each has its own 64 byte Tx buffer and 512 byte
Rx buffer. One UART can be connected to either the ESP of joystick
port while the other can be connected to the Raspberry Pi accelerator
or joystick port. The UARTS are controlled using ports \$37, \$133B,
\$143B, \$153B, and \$163B. The UARTs are connected to the IM2
interrupt system.  Nextreg \$c6 allows interrupts to be enabled for
the status of each UART. UART interrupts correspond to interrupts 1,
2, 12, and 13 (see Interrupts).

TBBlue stores configuration state in a field of registers. These
registers are accessible via two I/O ports or via the special nextreg
instructions.

Port \$243B (9275) is used to set the register number, listed below.

Port \$253B (9531) is used to access the register value.

Some registers are accessible only during the initialization process.

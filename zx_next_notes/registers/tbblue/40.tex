\register{R/W}{40}{Palette Index Select}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = Palette Index Number
\end{itemize}
Selects the palette index to change the associated colour

For ULA only, INKs are mapped to indices 0 through 7, BRIGHT INKs to
indices 8 through 15, PAPERs to indices 16 through 23 and BRIGHT
PAPERs to indices 24 through 31.  In EnhancedULA mode, INKs come from
a subset of indices from 0 through 127 and PAPERs from a subset of
indices from 128 through 255.

The number of active indices depends on the number of attribute bits
assigned to INK and PAPER out of the attribute byte.

In ULAplus mode, the last 64 entries (indices 192 to 255) hold the
ULAplus palette.  The ULA always takes border colour from PAPER for
standard ULA and Enhanced ULA

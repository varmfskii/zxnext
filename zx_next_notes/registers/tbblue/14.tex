\register{R/W}{14}{Global transparency color}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = Transparency color value (\$E3 after a reset)
\end{itemize}
(Note: this value is 8-bit, so the transparency is compared against
only by the MSB bits of the final 9-bit colour)\\
(Note2: this only affects Layer 2, ULA and LoRes. Sprites use register
\$4B for transparency and tilemap uses nextreg \$4C)

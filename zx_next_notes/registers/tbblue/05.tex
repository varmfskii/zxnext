\register{R/W}{05}{Peripheral 1 Settings}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-6 = joystick 1 mode (MSB)
\item bits 5-4 = joystick 2 mode (MSB)
\item bit 3 = joystick 1 mode (LSB)
\item bit 2 = 50/60 Hz mode (0 = 50Hz, 1 = 60Hz)
\item bit 1 = joystick 2 mode (LSB)
\item bit 0 = Enable Scandoubler
\end{itemize}
Joystick modes
\begin{itemize}
\item 000 = Sinclair 2 (67890)
\item 001 = Kempston 2 (port \$37)
\item 010 = Kempston 1 (port \$1F)
\item 011 = Megadrive 1 (port \$1F)
\item 100 = Cursor
\item 101 = Megadrive 2 (port \$37)
\item 110 = Sinclair 1 (12345)
\item 111 = I/O Mode (3.01.04)
Both joysticks are places in I/O Mode if either is set to I/O
Mode. The underlying joystick type is not changed and reads of this
register will continue to return the last joystick type. Ehether the
joystick is in io mode or not is invisible but this state can be
cleared either through reset or by re-writing the gegister with
joystick type not equal to 111. Recovery time for a normal joystick
read after leaving I/O Mode is at most 64 scan lines.

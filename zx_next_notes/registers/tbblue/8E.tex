\register{R/W}{8E}{Spectrum 128k Memory Mapping (3.01.01)}
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Bank number bit 3 (port \$dffd bit 0)
\item bit 6-4 = Bank number bits 2-0 (port \$7ffd bits 2-0)
\item bit 3 = Enable change ram page (read as 1)
\item bit 2 = Paging mode (port \$1ffd bit 0)
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 = Normal paging mode
\item 1 = Special paging mode (lot bit of memory configuration)
\end{itemize}
\item[] Normal Paging Mode
\item bits 1-0 = ROM selection (port \$1ffd bit 1 and \$7ffd bit 4)
\item[] Special (all RAM) Paging Mode
\item bits 1-0 = RAM configuration selection (port \$1ffd bits 2-1)
\end{itemize}
Writes can affect all ports \$7ffd, \$dffd, and \$1ffd\\
Writes can always change the ROM/allRAM mapping\\
Writes immediately change the current MMU mapping as if by port write.

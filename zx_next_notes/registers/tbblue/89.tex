\register{R/W}{89}{Expansion Port decoding control 4/4}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-1 = Reserved
\item bit 0 = Enable ULAplus (Ports \$BF3B, \$FF3B) (1 on reset)
\end{itemize}

The Internal Port Decoding Enables always apply.

When the Expansion Bus is enabled, the Expansion Bus Port Decoding
Enables are logically ANDed with the Internal Enables. A result of 0
for the corresponding bit indicates the internal device is
\emph{disabled}. If the Expansion Bus is enabled, this allows
I/O cycles for disabled ports to propagate to the Expansion Bus,
otherwise corresponding I/O cycles to the Expansion Bus are filtered.

\register{W}{63}{Copper Data 16-bit Write}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = Byte to write to copper instruction memory
\end{itemize}
The 16-bit value is written in pairs. The first 8-bits are the MSB and
are destined for an even copper instruction address. The sesond 8-bits
are the LSB and are destined for an odd copper instruction address.

After each write, the copper address is auto-incremented to the next
memory position.

After a write to an odd address, the all 16-bits are written to copper
memory at once.

\register{R/W}{81}{Expansion Bus Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = (R) Expansion bus \textoverline{ROMCS} asserted
\item bits 6-5 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bit 4 = (W) Propagate max CPU clock at all times (0 on hard
  reset)
\item bits 3-2 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bits 1-0 = Max CPU Speed when Expansion Bus is enabled (\$00 on
  hard reset, currently fixed at \$00)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 00 = 3.5 MHz
  \item 01 = 7 MHz
  \item 10 = 14 MHz
  \item 11 = 28 MHz

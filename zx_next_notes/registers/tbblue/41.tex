\register{R/W}{41}{8-bit Palette Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = Colour Entry in RRRGGGBB format
\end{itemize}
The lower blue bit of the 9-bit internal colour will be the logical or
of bits 0 and 1 of the 8-bit entry. After each write, the palette
index auto-increments if aut-increment has been enabled (NextReg \$43
bit 7), Reads do not auto-increment.

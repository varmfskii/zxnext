\register{R/W}{C8}{Interrupt Status 2} (3.01.08)\\
(\$00 on reset)
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Reserved, must be zero
\item bit 6 = UART1 Tx empty
\item bit 5 = UART1 Rx almost full *
\item bit 4 = UART1 Rx available *
\item bit 3 = Reserved must be zero
\item bit 2 = UART0 Tx empty
\item bit 1 = UART0 Rx almost full *
\item bit 0 = UART0 Rx available *
\end{itemize}
* For each UART Rx half full and Rx available are shared interrupts
** Reads return current interrupt status
** Writes clear status bits where bits are set

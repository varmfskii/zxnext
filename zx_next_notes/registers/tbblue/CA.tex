\register{R/W}{CA}{Interrupt Status 2 (3.01.09)}
(\$00 on reset)
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Reserved, must be zero
\item bit 6 = UART1 Tx empty
\item bit 5 = UART1 Rx almost full *
\item bit 4 = UART1 Rx available *
\item bit 3 = Reserved must be zero
\item bit 2 = UART0 Tx empty
\item bit 1 = UART0 Rx almost full *
\item bit 0 = UART0 Rx available *
\end{itemize}
* For each UART Rx half full and Rx available are shared interrupts
** Set bits indicate the device generated an interrupt in the past
** Writes clear bits where bits are set except in IM2 mode

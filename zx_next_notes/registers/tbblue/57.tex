\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = 8k RAM page at position \$E000 to \$FFFF (\$01 on
  reset)
\end{itemize}
Pages can be from 0 to 223 on a fully expanded Next.

Writing to ports \$1FFD, \$7FFD and \$DFFD writes \$FF to MMU0 and
MMU1 and writes appropriate values to MMU6 and MMU7 to map in the
selected 16k bank.

+3 special modes override the MMUs if used.

Level 2
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 1st write
\item bits 7-0 = MSB (RRRGGGBB)
\item[] 2nd write
\item bit 7 = Priority
\item bits 6-1 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bit 0 = LSB (B)
\end{itemize}
9-bit Palette Data is entered in two consecutive writes; the second
write autoincrements the palette index if auto-increment is enabled in
NextREG \$43 bit 7

If writing an L2 palette, the second write's D7 holds the L2 priority
bit which if set (1) brings the colour defined at that index on top of
all other layers. If you also need the same colour in regular priority
(for example: for enviromental masking) you will have to set it up
again, this time with no priority.

Reads return the second byte and do not autoincrement.

\register{R/W}{C6}{Interrupt Enable 2} (3.01.08)\\
(\$00 on reset)
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bit 6 = UART1 Tx empty
\item bit 5 = UART1 Rx half full *
\item bit 4 = UART1 Rx available *
\item bit 3 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bit 2 = UART0 Tx empty
\item bit 1 = UART0 Rx half full *
\item bit 0 = UART0 Rx available *
\end{itemize}
* For each UART, Rx half full and Rx available are shared interrupts

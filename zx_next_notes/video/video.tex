\chapter{Video}

ZX Spectrum Next video splits the display types into four categories
(layer 1 (ULA/Timex/LoRes), layer 2, layer 3 (tilemap) and sprites)
which have their own sets of controls for colour palettes, clipping,
and scrolling. Some aspects of ULA and tilemap are tied together, but
all the rest operate in a largely independent manner using a layering
system. The ULA category has a number of separate video modes that it
can use. One of these (LoRes) is incompatible with using tilemaps.

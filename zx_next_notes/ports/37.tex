\begin{itemize}
\item[] bit 7 = ''start'' button
\item[] bit 6 = A/X button
\item[] bit 5 = C/Z button
\item[] bit 4 = Fire/C/Y button
\item[] bit 3 = Up
\item[] bit 2 = Down
\item[] bit 1 = Left
\item[] bit 0 = Right
\end{itemize}
Disable with Nextreg \$05\\
Write (\$00 on reset, 3.01.04)
\begin{itemize}
\item[] bits 7-6 = Select I/O Mode
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] 00 = Bit Bang
  \item[] 01 = Clock
  \item[] 10 = UART
  \item[] 11 = Reserved (don't use)
  \end{itemize}
\item[] bit 5 = Reserved, must be 0
\item[] bit 4 = Select Joystick Port for Read
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] 0 = Left
  \item[] 1 = Right
  \end{itemize}
\item[] bits 3-1 = Reserved, must be \$00
\item[] bit 0 = Pin 7 state (both ports)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bit Bang - bit 0 on pin 7
  \item Clock - clock on pin 7\\
    0 = Slow clock (Fsys/2048 = 12.672 kHz)\\
    1 = Fast clock (Fsys/8 = 3.5 MHz)
  \item UART - Pin 7 = TX, Pin 9 = RX
    0 = ESP\\
    1 = Pi
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
** A Runt clock may appear in the first cycle\\
The I/O mode should be set by writing this port first followed by
enabling io mo de on the joysticks with a write to nextreg 0x05.

GRB palette entries</A>

<P>
G3R3B2 encoding
<BR>For a device using the GRB colour space the palette entry is
interpreted as follows
<table width="90%"><tr><td align="right" valign="top"><#4999#><#4996#><#4996#><#4999#></td><td valign="top">&nbsp;Bits 0-1: Blue intensity.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top"><#5000#><#4997#><#4997#><#5000#></td><td valign="top">&nbsp;Bits 2-4: Red intensity.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top"><#5001#><#4998#><#4998#><#5001#></td><td valign="top">&nbsp;Bits 5-7: Green intensity.
</td></tr></table>


<P>
This colour space uses a sub-set of 9-bit GRB. The missing lowest blue
bit is set to OR of the other two blue bits (Bb becomes 000 for 00,
and Bb1 for anything else). This gives access to a fixed half the
potential 512 colour palette. The reduces the jump in intensity in the
lower range in the earlier version of the specification. It also means
the standard palette can now be represented by the ULAplus palette.

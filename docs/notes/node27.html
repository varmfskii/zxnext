The tilemap is a logical extension of the ULA and its data structures
are contained in the ULAís 16k bank 5. If both the ULA and tilemap are
enabled, this means that the tilemapís map and tile definitions should
be arranged within the 16k to avoid overlap with the display ram used
by the ULA.

<P>
The tilemap exists on the same display layer as the ULA. The graphics
generated by the ULA and tilemap are combined before being forwarded
to the SLU layer system as layer U.

Alternate Page Mode</A>

<P>
Timex mode 1

<P>
This mode is the same as ZX Spectrum mode at alternate
addresses. Alternate page mode is selected by enabling Timex modes by
writing 00xxxx1xx to Next register $08 (8, Peripheral 3 setting) then
writing 1 to the Timex ULA port ($ff).  It is identical to ZX
Spectrum mode except the pixel are mapped to the bitmap 2 area giving
use pixel addresses of <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math71#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline176#</SPAN> and
the attributes to the attribute 2 area with addresses of
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math72#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline178#</SPAN>.

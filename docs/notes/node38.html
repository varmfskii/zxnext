4-Bit Sprite Patterns</A>
</H5>

<P>
The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline755#</SPAN> pixel image uses 4-bits for each pixel so that each
pixel can be one of 16 colours. One colour indicates transparency and
this is programmed into the lower 4-bits of the Sprite Transparency
Index register (nextreg $4B). By default the transparency value is
$3. Note that the same register is shared with 8-bit patterns to
identify the transparent index.

<P>
Since each pixel only occupies 4-bits, two pixels are stored in each
byte. The leftmost pixel is stored in the upper 4-bits and the
rightmost pixel is stored in the lower 4-bits.

<P>
As an example we will use the same sprite image as was given in the
8-bit pattern example. Here only the lower 4 bits of each pixel is
retained to confine each pixelâ€™s color to 4-bits:

<P>
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim10#</PRE>

<P>
$3 is used as the transparent index.

<P>
These 128 bytes would be stored in pattern memory in left to right,
top to bottom order.

<P>
The actual colour that will appear on screen will depend on the
palette, described below. The default palette will not likely generate
suitable colours for 4-bit sprites.

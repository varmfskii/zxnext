Sprite Palette
</H2>
Each pixel of a sprite image is 8-bit for 8-bit patterns or 4-bit for
4-bit patterns. The pixel value is known as a pixel colour index. This
colour index is combined with the sprite’s palette offset. The palette
offset is a 4-bit value added to the top 4-bits of the pixel colour
index. The purpose of the palette offset is to allow a sprite to
change the colour of an image.

<P>
The final sprite colour index generated by the sprite hardware is then
the sum of the pixel index and the 4-bit palette offset. In pictures
using binary math:

<P>
Where “PPPP” is the 4-bit palette offset from the sprite’s attributes
and the “I”s represent the pixel value from the sprite pattern. The
final sprite index is represented by the 8-bit value “SSSSSSSS”.

<P>
For 4-bit sprites the palette offset can be thought of as selecting
one of 16 different 16-colour palettes.

<P>
This final 8-bit sprite index is then passed through the sprite
palette which acts like a lookup table that returns the 9-bit RGB333
colour associated with the sprite index.

<P>
At power up, the sprite palette is initialized such that the sprite
index passes through unchanged and is therefore interpretted as an
RGB332 colour. The missing third blue bit is generated as the logical
OR of the two other blue bits. In short, for 8-bit sprites, the sprite
index also acts like the colour when using the default palette.

<P>

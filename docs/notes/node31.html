<OL>
<LI>Addition of a bit to Tilemap Control to select a reduced tilemap
  area of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline498#</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline500#</SPAN> that covers the ULA
  screen.
</LI>
<LI>Addition of a bit to Tilemap Control to select split addressing
  where the tilemapâ€™s tiles and attributes as well as the tile
  definitions are split between the two 8k halves of the 16k ULA ram
  in the same way that the two Timex display files are split. The
  intention is to make it easier for the tilemap to co-exist with all
  the display modes of the ULA.

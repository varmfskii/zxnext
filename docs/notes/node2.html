Introduction</A>

The ZX Spectrum Next is an extension of the original ZX Spectrum
implemented in FPGA which implements many of the common additions to
the system includin the characteristics of all of the original ZX
Spectrum line, including the Timex/Sinclair 2068, along with a number
of characteristics to modernize the design.

<P>
This document is an attempt to consolidate the programming interface
for the ZX Spectrum Next into a single location. This document started
when much of the documentation on the ZX Spectrum Next site
(https://www.specnext.com/) was out of date and/or difficult to figure
out. The way to figure out how things actually worked was to either
dig through the forums and ask questions or find someones code that
implemented a particular bit of functionality and reverse engineer
it. The situation has greatly improved and this document may even be
redundant at this point.

Description from http://www.specnext.com/about/:

<P>
The Spectrum Next is fully implemented with FPGA technology, ensuring
it can be upgraded and enhanced while remaining truly compatible with
the original hardware by using special memory chips and clever
design. Hereâ€™s what under the hood of the machine:

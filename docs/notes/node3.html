<P>
ZX Spectrum Next video splits the display types into four categories
(ULA, tilemap, layer 2, and sprites) which have their own sets of
controls for colour palettes, clipping, and scrolling. Some aspects of
ULA and tilemap are tied together, but all the rest operate in a
largely independent manner using a layering system. The ULA category
has a number of separate video modes that it can use. One of these
(LoRes) is incompatible with using tilemaps.

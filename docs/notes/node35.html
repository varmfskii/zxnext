Sprite Patterns</A>
</H2>
Sprite patterns are the images that each sprite can take on. The
images are stored in a 16K memory internal to the FPGA and are
identified by pattern number. A particular sprite chooses a pattern by
storing a pattern number in its attributes.

<P>
All sprites are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline745#</SPAN> pixels in size but the come in two
flavours: 4-bit and 8-bit. The bit width describes how many bits are
used to code the colour of each pixel.

<P>
An 8-bit sprite uses a full byte to colour each of its pixels so that
each pixel can be one of 256 colours. In this case, a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline747#</SPAN>
sprite requires 256 bytes of pattern memory to store its image.

<P>
A 4-bit sprite uses a nibble to colour each of its pixels so that each
pixel can be one of 16 colours. In this case, a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline749#</SPAN> sprite
requires just 128 bytes of pattern memory to store its image.

<P>
The 16K pattern memory can contain any combination of these images,
whether they are 128 bytes or 256 bytes and their locations in the
pattern memory are described by a pattern number. This pattern number
is 7 bits with bits named as follows:

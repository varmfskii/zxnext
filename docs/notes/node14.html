ULA group</A>
</H1>
The ULA layer supports ZX Spectrum video, Timex video modes, and the
Spectrum Nextâ€™s lores video mode all use 16k memory bank 5 or 7 with
the data coming from some combination of addresses $0000-$17FF
(bitmap 1), $1800-$1AFF (attribute 1), $2000-$37FF (bitmap 2), and
$3800-$3AFF (attribute 2) within the selected bank.  Assuming
default memory mapping and the use of bank 5 this will be mapped as
some combination of memory $4000-$57FF, $5800-$5AFF,
$6000-$77FF, $780-$7AFF. All of the modes other than the lores
mode can either use the default ZX Spectrum colours, or ULANext mode
which uses a 256 entry palette to determine the colour. In the
Spectrum and Timex modes all colours are either Paper (foreground),
paper (background), or border colours.

Tile Definitions</A>

The second data structure is the tile definitions themselves.

<P>
Each tile, identified by tile number, is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline464#</SPAN> pixels in size
with each pixel four bits to select one of 16 colours. A tile
definition occupies 32 bytes and is defined in X major order with
packing in the X direction in the same way that 4-bit sprites are
defined. The 4-bit colour of each pixel is augmented by the 4-bit
palette offset from the tilemap in the most significant bits to form
an 8-bit colour index that is looked up in the tilemap palette to
determine the final 9-bit colour sent to the display.

<P>
Tiles are therefore defined using 16 colours with the tilemap palette
offset able to act as index into the tilemap palette to vary the
display colour. One of the 16 colours is defined as transparent in the
Transparency Index register.

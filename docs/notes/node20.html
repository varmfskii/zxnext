Lo-Resolution Mode</A>
</H2>

<P>
This is a Spectrum Next specific video mode with a resolution of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline202#</SPAN> replacing the old Radistan mode.  It allows for
independent selection from the 256 entries in the ULA palette on a
pixel by pixel basis. The pixel data is mapped into the bitmap 1 and
bitmap 2 areas.  It is selected by writing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline204#</SPAN> to Next register
$15 (21, the sprites and layers register).  Each byte corresponds to
a ULA palette entry and bytes are mapped linearly in a row-wise
fashion.

<LI>512 Tile Mode. In 2.00.26, the 512 tile mode was automatically
  selected when the ULA was disabled. With the ULA disabled, the
  tilemap attribute bit “ULA on top” was re-purposed to be bit 8 of
  the tile number. In 2.00.27, selection of the 512 tile mode is moved
  to bit 1 of Tilemap Control nextreg $6B. This way 512 tile mode can
  be independently chosen without disabling the ULA. The “ULA on top”
  bit is still taken as bit 8 of the tile number and in the 512 mode,
  the tilemap is always displayed underneath the ULA.

<LI>Tilemap Always On Top of ULA. In 2.00.27, bit 0 of Tilemap
  Control nextreg $6B is used to indicate that the tilemap should
  always be displayed on top of the ULA. This allows the tilemap to
  display over the ULA when in 512 mode.

Combining ULA <tex2html_ampersand_mark> Tilemap</A>
</H2>
The combination of the ULA and tilemap is done in one of two modes:
the standard mode or the stencil mode.

<P>
The standard mode uses bit 8 of a tile's tilemap entry to determine if
a tile is above or below the ULA. The source of the final pixel
generated is then the topmost non-transparent pixel. If the ULA or
tilemap is disabled then they are treated as transparent.

<P>
The stencil mode will only be applied if both the ULA and tilemap are
enabled. In the stencil mode, the final pixel will be transparent if
either the ULA or tilemap are transparent. Otherwise the final pixel
is a logical AND of the corresponding colour bits. The stencil mode
allows one layer to act as a cut-out for the other.

<P>

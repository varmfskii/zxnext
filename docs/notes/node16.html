ZX Spectrum Mode</A>
</H2>

<P>
Timex mode 0

<P>
This is the default ULA mode and has its origins in the original ZX
Spectrum. It uses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline156#</SPAN> pixels with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline158#</SPAN> colour
attribute areas mapped into a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline160#</SPAN> grid. If Timex modes are
not enabled, this and the LoRes mode are the only ones available, so
you would switch back to this mode by writing 000xxxxx to Next
register $15 (21, the sprites and layers register). If another Timex
mode is enabled, then this is mode 0 so you would write 0 to port $ff
to enable it. This is a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline162#</SPAN> video mode. The bitmap 1 area
is used for selection between ink and paper colours with one bit per
pixel and the attribute 1 area for colour attributes.

<P>
The easiest way to visualize the mapping of this mode is to think of
the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline164#</SPAN> area as being divided into a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline166#</SPAN> grid of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline168#</SPAN> characters.  IF we consider X and Y as the position in the
grid and R to the the row within the character.  For ink/paper
selection, 0=paper, 1=ink and the entries are stored left to right as
lsb to msb within the bye.  The address for a pixel value is:
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math69#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline170#</SPAN>. Each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline172#</SPAN> cell has
its own colour attribute where the address for an attribute cell is
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math70#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline174#</SPAN> in other words mapped lineally
column-wise starting at the beginning of the attribute 1 area.

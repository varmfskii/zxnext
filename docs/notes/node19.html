Pixels are mapped into both the bitmap 1 and bitmap 2 areas where
8-pixel wide character columns alternate between the two bitmap areas.
The pixels within a byte being rendered left to right lsb to msb as in
other Spectrum video modes.  The addresses for each row within a
character are based on a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline194#</SPAN> grid of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline196#</SPAN> characters
which using a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline198#</SPAN> R, C, and Y scheme gives us addresses of
the form <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math75#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline200#</SPAN>.

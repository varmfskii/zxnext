The 64 colour mode lookup table is organized as 4 palettes of 16
colours.

<P>
Bits 7 and 6 of each Spectrum attribute byte (normally used for FLASH
and BRIGHT) will be used as an index value (0-3) to select one of the
four colour palettes.

<P>
Each colour palette has 16 entries (8 for INK, 8 for PAPER). Bits 0 to
2 (INK) and 3 to 5 (PAPER) of the attribute byte will be used as
indexes to retrieve colour data from the selected palette.

<P>
With the standard Spectrum display, the BORDER colour is the same as
the PAPER colour in the first CLUT. For example BORDER 0 would set the
border to the same colour as PAPER 0 (with the BRIGHT and FLASH bits
not set).

<P>
The complete index can be calculated as
<BR>ink_colour = (FLASH * 2 + BRIGHT) * 16 + INK
paper_colour = (FLASH * 2 + BRIGHT) * 16 + PAPER + 8

Limitations</A>

Although in theory 64 colours can be displayed at once, in practice
this is usually not possible except when displaying colour bars,
because the four CLUTs are mutually exclusive; it is not possible to
mix colours from two CLUTs in the same cell. However, with software
palette cycling it is possible to display all 256 colours on screen at
once.

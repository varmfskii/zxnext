General Description</A>
</H2>
The tilemap is a hardware character oriented display that comes in two
resolutions: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline446#</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline448#</SPAN> pixels) and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline450#</SPAN>
(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline452#</SPAN> pixels).

<P>
The display area on screen is the same as the sprite layer, meaning it
overlaps the standard <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline454#</SPAN> area by 32 pixels on all
sides. Vertically this is larger than the physical HDMI display, which
will cut off the top and bottom character rows making the visible area
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline456#</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline458#</SPAN>, but the full area is visible on VGA.

<P>
The obvious application for the tilemap is for a fast, clearly
readable and wide multicoloured character display. Less obvious
perhaps is that it can also be used to make fast and wide resolution
full colour backgrounds with easily animated components.

<P>
The tilemap is defined by two data structures.

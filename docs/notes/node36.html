Pattern Number</A>
</H4>

N6, despite the name, is the least significant bit.

<P>
This 7-bit pattern number can identify 128 patterns in the 16k pattern
memory, each of which are 128 bytes in size. The full 7-bits are
therefore used for 4-bit sprites.

<P>
For 8-bit sprites, N6=0 always. The remaining 6 bits can identify 64
patterns, each of which is 256 bytes in size.

<P>
The N5:N0,N6 bits are stored in a particular spriteâ€™s attributes to
identify which image a sprite uses.

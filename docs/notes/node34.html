The Spectrum Next has a hardware sprite system with the following
characteristics:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Total of 128 sprites
</LI>
<LI>Display surface is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline727#</SPAN> overlapping the ULA screen by
  32 pixels on each side
</LI>
<LI>Minimum of 100 sprites per scanline*
</LI>
<LI>Choice of 512 colours for each pixel
</LI>
<LI>Site of each sprite is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline729#</SPAN> pixels but sprites can be
  magnified <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline731#</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline733#</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline735#</SPAN> horizontally and
  vertically
</LI>
<LI>Sprites can be mirrored and rotated
</LI>
<LI>Sprites can be grouped together to form larger sprites under the
  control of a single anchor
</LI>
<LI>A 16K pattern memory can contain 64 8-bit sprite images or 128
  4-bit sprite images and combinations in-between
</LI>
<LI>A per sprite palette offset allows sprites to share images but
  colour them differently
</LI>
<LI>A nextreg interface allows the copper to move sprites during the
  video frame
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
*A minimum of 100 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline737#</SPAN> sprites is guaranteed to be displayed
in any scanline. Any additional sprites will not be displayed with the
hardware ensuring sprites are not partially plotted.

<P>
The actual limit is determined by how many 28MHz clock cycles there
are in a scanline. The sprite hardware is able to plot one pixel cycle
and uses one cycle to qualify each sprite. Since the number of cycles
there are in a scanline varies with video timing (HDMI, VGA), the
number of pixels that can be plotted also varies but the minimum will
be 1600 pixels per line including overhead cycles needed to qualify
100 sprites. Since sprites magified horizontally involve plotting more
pixels, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline739#</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline741#</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline743#</SPAN> sprites will take more
cycles to plot and the presence of these sprites in a line will reduce
the total number of sprites that can be plotted.

<P>
